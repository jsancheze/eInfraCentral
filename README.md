# eInfraCentral
The mission of eInfraCentral is to “ensure that by 2020 a broader and more varied set of users discovers and accesses the existing and emerging e-Infrastructure capacity and e-Infrastructure Services”. Crucial in achieving the eInfraCentral goal is, among others, a) describing and b) exchanging service-related information in a formal way to allow for increase in accessibility, discoverability, interoperability, aggregation, monitoring and comparison of services and thus their uptake and to allow for enhancing the understanding of gaps and improvements that could be delivered by e-infrastructure services. From this process, eInfraCentral has devised a Service Description Template for an entry in a Service Catalogue. The Service Description Information is organised in various blocks of information: Basic Service Information, Service Classification Information, Service Support Information, Service Contrac-tual Information and Service Performance Information. The Service Description Template provides a definition, potential values and their format (if any) as well as information related to whether the information is related only to the catalogue or to the overall portfolio (Use column) as well as whether the attribute is mandatory or optional for the implementation of a number of features in the eInfraCentral platform/common catalogue.
